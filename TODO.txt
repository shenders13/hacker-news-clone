ToDo List

0. add url to story schema and make title's link to the actual story

1. change serverHelpers.js to storyHelpers.js

2. create an authorHelpers.js file

3. make a getAuthorData method in authorHelpers.js

4. authorHelpers.js should ping the Hacker News API and retrieve their
id (username), karma, and an array of id's that correspond to all the 
submissions they have made

5. a callback function should store each author object into the database
  - create an AuthorModel

6. make a route in server.js called 'update-authors' that will call the 
authorHelper function

7. make a fetchAuthors Helper in ajaxHelpers that will ping the DB for author
  info

8. make author text be an <Link> tag that changes to route /author/:id
  - npm install 'react-router' and require it in the needed module
  - make a router in index.js and make it replace current 'ReactDOM.render...'
  - make author text have /author/karma/#submissions be in the <Link> tag

9. make an author component that shows a given author's summary from params

10. add the author component to the router (using params)

11. put App component in its own file and import it

12. put the hero image in App, change the router so that App is the parent route, and put {this.props.children} under the image tag in the App component

13. we could then put the stories component as the index route
